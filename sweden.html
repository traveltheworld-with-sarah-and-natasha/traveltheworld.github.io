<h2>The colours of Stockholm</h2></div>

<div class="child7">
<p>The city encompasses many islands with colourful buildings standing tall on the ground. Stockholm’s spirit reflects the fact that the Eurosong contest is more important
     than the presidential elections. Swedes ride bikes and care for the environment.</p>
</div>


<div class="child8">
<h3>Swedish islands</h3>
</div>

<div class="child7">
<p>Sweden is the first country in the world according to the number of islands which are part of its territory. That total number of the islands is 267 570, according to Statistics Sweden’s 2013 Islands. Only 984 islands are inhabited.</p>

<h3>Eurosong and ABBA</h3>
</div>


<div class="child7"><p>Sweden is a country where the Eurosong contest is more important than the presidential elections. That is why they are the second nation by the number of victories. The first place is reserved for Ireland with only one victory ahead.

    Not to anyone’s surprise is the ABBA museum on Djurgarden island in Stockholm, devoted to one of the most successful pop groups who won the Eurosong Contest in 1974, bringing Sweden the first victory.                  </p></div>



    
<div class="child8">

    <h3>Viking museum</h3>
    </div>


    <div class="child7"><p>Not far from the ABBA museum is another museum devoted to Vikings. The place is well equipped with facts and depiction of Viking’s way of life, interactive and suitable for children.

</div>

<div class="child7"><p>The Vikings were a very good sailors who reached the Caspian and the Dead Sea. They raided British churches, so some people see them as pirates of their time. They were also soldiers in Byzantium. We have historic evidence which confirms that their activities took place from 793 until 1066.

    The Vikings are the first Europeans who touched the ground of Greenland and North America.      </p> </div>

    <h3>Nordic museum</h3>
    </div>


    <div class="child7"><p>On the Djurgarden island is the Nordic (Nordiska) museum. It is situated in a beautiful building built in renaissance style in 1908. The museum shows the cultural history of Sweden from the 16th century onwards through clothing, jewellery, furniture, the life on indigenous people, customs and tradition.       </p> </div>

</div>

<div class="child7"><p> At the time of our visit, there was an exhibition about the climate change. Swedes look after their environment and it’s no surprise that Greta Thunberg comes from Stockholm.

    Exhibition showcased a lot of interesting facts about how the earth has changed and how people contribute toward that changed. There was a video where you could see how the size of the ice on the Arctic has shivered in the last 30 years.
    
    
    The world uses annual energy for the internet equivalent to what 8 nuclear reactors can produce in a year. If you watch two hours of Netflix every day all year around, the CO2 emissions that are produced are equivalent to flying 384 km in an aircraft, eating six kg of beef or driving just under 1000 km in  a new car.  The data comes from the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
    
    A classical example of a city that is already being negatively impacted by rising sea levels is Venice, which is expected to sink. Barcelona is waging a pitched battle with increased percipitation, since its roofs are not built for greatly increased rainfall.
    
    We are at the risk of unreliable food supply and the crash in the food system’s ability to function due to warming, drought, flooding, variations in precipitation, and extreme precipitation especially in rural and urban area.
    
    The net sea level rise in the Baltic is expected to be 50-70 cm by the end of the century.
    
    All these conclusions are based on findings of Swedish Meteorolgical and Hydrological Institute.
    
    The oceans absorb the carbon-dioxide from the atmosphere. A large quantities of CO2 in the water form carbonic acid. The consequence of this is the death of coral reefs. Besides serving as a food for 2 million species, reefs provide protection against flooding, storms and rising sea levels.  </p> </div>

        <h3>Gamla Stan</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="child7"><p>Gamla Stan is an old town of Stockholm where you can find various restaurants, colourful houses and Nobel museum.  Most of the houses  date back to 16th and 17th century . They are protected from renovation.  </p> </div>
     
        <div class="child9">
        <img src="colourfulhouses.jpg" alt="palace" width="45%" height="45%">

        </div>

        <div class="child7"><p>Rich people used to have houses painted in yellow. There is no explanation as to why but we can only guess is due to yellow being the colour of gold. They also tend to have more windows on the house. Others who could not afford so many windows, would paint ones on the façade. Having more windows would mean that you will need to spend more on the glass and have high ceiling, which will cost you more to heat up during the winter. Therefore, if your house is painted in yellow and has lots of windows, that meant the rich person owned it. These colourful houses are situated on the Stortoget square and next to them is a Nobel museum.  </p> </div>

                </div>


                <div class="child7"><p>Alfred Nobel was born in Stockholm in 1833. As a teenager, Alfred was sent to Europe and the USA to deepen his knowledge in chemistry and engineering. This made him a well-travelled young man who spoke five languages. At heart, Nobel was an outgoing person, but had the soul of researcher and artist. He became famous for dynamite which he invented after the explosion happened in his factory which killed his brother a a few more people.

                    Nobel had his factories in the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and France in the 19th century. At that time, Nobel resides in Paris and enjoys cultural life but continues to work frenetically. He discovered gelignite and smokless gunpowder known as ballistite.
                    
                    Nobel was aspired writer but never had enough time to devote to this passion of his own.
                    
                    In his will, he wrote that most of fortune should be used to fund awards in physics, chemistry, physiology, literature and peace. This is how Nobel prize was established.   </p></div>
